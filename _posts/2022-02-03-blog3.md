title: Blog Post 3 Web Scrapping
---
In this blog post, I would explain how to make a super cool web scraper to find out
> What movie or TV shows share actors with your favorite movie or show?
 
[Here](https://github.com/lu18cheng/pic16b_IMDB_scraper) is the link to my project repository with all the code used in this project. 

# Web Scraper
First after activating our conda environment, we would create a scrapy project with
```
scrapy startproject IMDB_scraper
cd IMDB_scraper
```
This would create a set of files for our webscraping. 

Now we want to find a movie that we want to learn about. This blog would scrape the IMDB for _My Neighbor Totoro_ using [this link](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096283/).

In the folder `IMDB_scraper/spiders`, we create a python file `imdb_spider.py` and define a class `ImdbSpider(scrapy.Spider)` with relevant functions `parse()`, `parse_full_credits()`, and `parse_actor_page()` to scrape the webpage, casts in the movie or TV show and other films that the actor/actress is in. 

`class ImdbSpider` is defined as follows.
```python
class ImdbSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'imdb_spider'
    start_urls = ['https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096283/']
```

## `parse()`
The function `parse()` is defined as follows. It first finds all fields under `li.ipc-inline-list__item`, then extract link with text "Cast & crew" to get the link to display all cast and crew members in the film. At last, it calls `parse_full_credits` on the link we scraped to find out more about the cast members. 
```python
def parse(self, response):
    '''
    Assume that you start on a movie page
    then navigate to the Cast & Crew page
    '''

    #since all cast & crew page has the film link and /fullcredits/ in the end
    #we could just use the following to get cast & crew page
    yield scrapy.Request(response.urljoin("fullcredits/"),
                         callback=self.parse_full_credits)
    
    # #alternative way of getting the cast & crew website using css
    # elts = response.css("li.ipc-inline-list__item")
    # links = [e.css("a").attrib['href'] for e in elts
    #          if e.css("a::text") and e.css("a::text").get() == "Cast & crew"]
    # yield scrapy.Request(response.urljoin(links[0]), callback=self.parse_full_credits) 
```

## `parse_full_credits()`
The function `parse_full_credits()` is defined as follows. It first identify links to each cast member in the film. Then, for each cast on the cast and group page, it calls `parse_actor_page()` to scrape films that those actors/actresses are in. 
```python
def parse_full_credits(self, response):
    '''
    assume that you start on the Cast & Crew page.
    yield a `scrapy.Request` for the page of each actor listed on the page
    '''

    #get link to all cast members
    cast_links = [a.attrib['href'] for a in response.css("table.cast_list td.primary_photo a")]

    # yield result
    for link in cast_links:
        yield scrapy.Request(response.urljoin(link),
                             callback=self.parse_actor_page)
```


## `parse_actor_page()`
The function `parse_actor_page()` is defined as follows. It first extracts the name of the actor. Then it scrawl through the page to find films that the actor is in. `attrib(id)` is used to eliminate episodes information to prevent different episodes of the same work appear multiple times. 

```python
def parse_actor_page(self, response):
    '''
    assume that you start on the page of an actor.
    yield a dictionary with two key-value pairs of the form
    {"actor" : actor_name,
    "movie_or_TV_name" : movie_or_TV_name}.
    '''

    #get name of actor
    actor = response.css("h1.header span.itemprop::text").get()

    #get fields storing information of all films
    rows = response.css("div.filmo-row")
    # filter by `attr(id)` to get only main films and eliminate episodes information
    films = [e.css("a::text").get() for e in rows if e.css("::attr(id)") and e.css("a")]

    # yield result
    for film in films:
        yield {"actor": actor, "movie_or_TV_name": film}
```

## Scrape data
Now after all functions are defined, we are ready to scrape the data by running 
```python
scrapy crawl imdb_spider -o movies.csv
```
in the terminal. The program would scrape the actor and film names to a csv file.


# Data Analysis and Movie Recommendation

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

```python
df = pd.read_csv("movies.csv")
df.head()
```
<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>actor</th>
      <th>movie_or_TV_name</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>

      <td>Melanie MacQueen</td>

      <td>Melanie MacQueen</td>
      <td>Sons of Tucson</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

## Summary of Shared Actors and Recommendations
After running groupby on the dataframe. We find that _Fist of North Start_ shares the most common voice actors with _My Neighbor Totoro_ except for itself. If you like the voices or characters in _My Neighbor Totoro_, you may also like the following films.

```python
summaries = df.groupby("movie_or_TV_name").count()
summaries = summaries.sort_values(['actor'], ascending=False).rename(columns={'actor':'number of shared actors'})
summaries = summaries.reset_index()
summaries.head(10)
```
